## Data Science and Machine Learning Projects

This repository is a comprehensive collection of my completed projects and assignments in the fields of data science and machine learning. Each project showcases my expertise in working with Python, SQL, and various machine learning techniques to tackle real-world problems.

## Technologies Used

The projects in this repository leverage the following technologies:

- **Python**: A versatile programming language widely used in data science and machine learning. I utilize Python's powerful libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow to perform data manipulation, analysis, and model building.

- **SQL**: A domain-specific language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. I employ SQL to extract, transform, and load data for analysis and model training.

- **Machine Learning**: A field of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. I apply various machine learning algorithms, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and deep learning, to solve complex problems and gain insights from data.

I invite you to explore the projects within this repository to gain insights into my data science and machine learning expertise. Should you have any questions or wish to discuss potential collaborations, please feel free to reach out.

Happy coding!
